GetImageDetails
---------------
The GetImageDetails call returns the detailed image metadata for all specified images.

###GetImageDetails vs. [SearchForImages][]
You may wonder why [SearchForImages][] returns only a subset of the image 
metadata available from GetImageDetails. The differences in the two calls are 
intended to support the most common user workflow. [SearchForImages][] supports 
finding an image that matches the selected criteria. GetImageDetails assumes you 
have found some possible matches via [SearchForImages][], but you want to know 
more about a particular image to help you decide whether to download it.

###Image Sizes 
Due to a wide variety of available image resolutions, the images are grouped into a 
handful of size categories for simplicity. This operation returns size information 
about each image, including a sizekey which you can use used when requesting 
authorization to download the image.
