At this time, our code samples are quite out of date and are not supported. They lack the following:

- OAuth samples
- no SearchForVideos examples
- examples that use the most recent SearchForImages endpoint
- sort order optimization

The samples may serve to give you a high level intro to our APIs, but please note that they are not complete.
