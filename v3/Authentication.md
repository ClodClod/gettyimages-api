## Authentication ##

Use the  endpoint to get access tokens. Access tokens provide authorized access to certain resources. These tokens can be granted based on client credential, user credentials, or both. We currently support the OAuth2 Client Credentials, Implicit Grant, and Resource Owner grant flows. See our OAuth2 documentation on 
["**Getty Images' GitHub**"](https://github.com/gettyimages/connect/blob/master/documentation/endpoints/oauth2/README.md)
for details.

Use of the new Connect API requires an API key that identifies your company or organization.  You may request an API key for testing and evaluation purposes on our ["**Getty Images API Registration"**](https://api.gettyimages.com/member/register) page.
